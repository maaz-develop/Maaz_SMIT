    <h1>The Majestic Lion</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>
        The <strong>lion</strong> (<em>Panthera leo</em>) is often referred to as the <q>King of the Jungle</q>. 
        Although lions actually live in grasslands and savannas, this title reflects their reputation for strength, courage, and leadership. 
        The lion is one of the most iconic animals in the world, symbolizing power and nobility in many cultures.
    </p>

    <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <p>
        Lions are large carnivorous mammals. A male lion can weigh up to 250 kg, while females are slightly smaller.
        They are known for their distinctive manes, which make them appear larger and more intimidating.
        A lion’s average lifespan in the wild is about 10<sup>–14</sup> years, but in captivity, they can live longer.
    </p>

    <h2>Social Structure and Behavior</h2>
    <p>
        Unlike most members of the cat family, lions are highly social animals. They live in groups known as <em>prides</em>.
        A pride usually consists of related females, their cubs, and a few adult males.
        Lions are cooperative hunters, often working together to bring down prey such as zebras, antelopes, and buffaloes.
    </p>

    <p>
        The lion’s roar can be heard up to 8 km away — a sound that helps them communicate and mark their territory.
        Scientists studying lion communication have observed that cubs begin practicing their roars as early as 3<sub>rd</sub> month after birth.
    </p>

    <h2>Cultural and Symbolic Importance</h2>
    <p>
        Throughout history, lions have appeared in art, mythology, and literature.
        They are symbols of bravery and royalty. For instance, in many cultures, a lion is used on coats of arms to represent strength and honor.
    </p>

    <blockquote cite="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/lion">
        "Lions have inspired humans for centuries, appearing in stories, sculptures, and national emblems all around the world."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The lion also plays a role in science and conservation. Organizations like <abbr title="World Wildlife Foundation">WWF</abbr> work tirelessly to protect lions from threats such as habitat loss and poaching.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The lion is not just a predator; it is a symbol of the wild’s beauty, balance, and strength. 
    Protecting this magnificent creature ensures that future generations can continue to admire the true <em>King of Beasts</em>.</p>
